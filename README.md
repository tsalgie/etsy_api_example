# Etsy API Example
An example of simple Etsy API use.
When provided with an Etsy API key as an argument, this application displays the top 5 terms from 10 predetermined storefronts.

### Motivation 
Sometimes it is useful to show an example where a 3rd party API is used, and then data is parsed. The Etsy API is a good candidate since it returns structured data for its storefronts.

### How To Use
Call `terms.py` on the commandline, providing your Etsy API key as an argument.
```
python.exe terms.py 123456789012345678901234
Top 5 terms for Store1 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
Top 5 terms for Store2 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
Top 5 terms for Store3 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
Top 5 terms for Store4 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
Top 5 terms for Store5 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
Top 5 terms for Store6 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
Top 5 terms for Store7 are: term1, term2, term3, term4, term5.
